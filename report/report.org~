* Introduction
** Objective
The goal of our analysis is to study the correlation between layoffs
and the number of job postings post-recession ranging from August 2007
to December 2015. Specifically, we study the trends across the
different states in the U.S. using choropleth visualization. 

** Importance
Answering such a question would help us understand how each state
recovered post-recession. The number of job postings is a proxy for
how opportunistic a particular state is, in terms of the job market. 

** Datasets
We used the following tables:
- Jobs
- Econ_state
- sectors
- companies
* Non-technical Summary
** Key findings
There are strong reasonable differences between the states. We observe
that in the period following the recession, specifically in December
2009, the number of job postings in US increased 10-fold. However, the
unemployment rate was still as high as 13%+. Interestingly, the
unemployment rate in Texas at this time was less than 5%.

* Technical Summary
We aggregated the monthly data for each state and across time period
2007-2015. Below, we have created two interactive choropleth
visualizations.

* Appendix
** Future directions
We also observed relevant skills from various job descriptions, and
how they evolved post-recession. Due to time limitation, we did not
complete this analysis.
