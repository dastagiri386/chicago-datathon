\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-1}
\subsection{Objective}
\label{sec-1-1}
The goal of our analysis is to study the correlation between layoffs
and the number of job postings post-recession ranging from August 2007
to December 2015. Specifically, we study the trends across the
different states in the U.S. using choropleth visualization. 

\subsection{Importance}
\label{sec-1-2}
Answering such a question would help us understand how each state
recovered post-recession. The number of job postings is a proxy for
how opportunistic a particular state is, in terms of the job market. 

\subsection{Datasets}
\label{sec-1-3}
We used the following tables:
\begin{itemize}
\item Jobs
\item Econ$_{\text{state}}$
\item sectors
\item companies
\end{itemize}
\section{Non-technical Summary}
\label{sec-2}
\subsection{Key findings}
\label{sec-2-1}
There are strong reasonable differences between the states. We observe
that in the period following the recession, specifically in December
2009, the number of job postings in US increased 10-fold. However, the
unemployment rate was still as high as 13+\%. Interestingly, the
unemployment rate in Texas at this time was less than 5\%.
